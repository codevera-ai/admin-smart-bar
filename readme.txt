A fast, searchable command palette for WordPress admin. Navigate your WordPress site like a pro with keyboard shortcuts and instant search.

== Description ==

Admin Smart Bar brings Mac Spotlight-style search to your WordPress admin. Instead of clicking through menus, just press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac), type what you're looking for, and go straight there.

= Features =

**Lightning-fast search**
Search across all your WordPress content:
* Posts and pages (including draft previews)
* Media files
* Users
* Page builder content (Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, Oxygen)

**Smart admin navigation**
Find WordPress admin pages instantly:
* Dashboard, posts, pages, media
* Comments, appearance, plugins, users
* Settings, tools, and more
* All submenu items included

**Plugin shortcuts**
If you have popular plugins installed, search their admin pages too:
* WooCommerce (products, orders, settings, analytics)
* Yoast SEO (settings, search appearance, tools)
* Elementor (templates, settings)
* Advanced Custom Fields (field groups)
* And many more

**Keyboard-first design**
* `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K` - Open search
* `↑` `↓` - Navigate results
* `Enter` - Open selected item
* `Esc` - Close search

**Quick actions**
Every search result shows quick actions:
* Edit - Jump to edit screen
* View - Open frontend view (published posts) or preview (drafts)

= Page builder support =

Admin Smart Bar automatically detects and searches content from popular page builders:
* Elementor - Searches widget content, headings, text
* Beaver Builder - Searches module content
* Divi Builder - Searches Divi sections and modules
* Oxygen Builder - Searches shortcode content

If a page builder is not installed, the plugin doesn't add any overhead.

* Does not collect any data
* Does not make external requests
* All searches happen on your server
* No tracking or analytics
